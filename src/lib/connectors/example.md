Predictable revenue playbook

SaaS companies structure- pipeline gen - sales pipeline into parts of the funnel top/mid/bot- 



Pipeline gen 

- usually marketing- Paid social, OOH, Influencer, etc divided by channels
- KPI: MQL (Marketing Qualified Leads)
- lead gen with lead magnets etc
- - funnel is more of a bowtie - upsell growth loops


### SDR: Sales Dev Representative (Open Pipeline) - Generate more leads

- Marketing have a definition of what a MQL is. MQLs get passed to the SDR, SDR does BANT then if qualified passed to AE
- Some AEs don’t have SDRs so they prospect, qualify, discover & close
- Calls, Emails etc. webinars, white-paper
- Some argue they should sit under Marketing but have a tight rel with Account Execs
- Those leads need to be qualified 
- BANT: Budget, Authority, Lead & Timeline - Do they fit the ICP
- B - Can they afford it, do they have the means
- A - Do they have the authority to sign the DocuSign
- Lead - 
- Time - Is the problem urgent for the company right now, are they actively trying to solve this problem.
### AE - Close pipeline

- SQL Sales Qualified Lead
- If its a good lead 


### AE Does Discovery (The Actual Selling Part - on the call) 

Convert Opportunities into Sales (SQO Sales Qualified Opportunity)

- Root causes of the problem and how painful it is
- What metrics are important to buyer?
- MEDIC / MEDPIC
- Metrics - Important to buyer
- Economic Buyer - Who’s budget does it come put of am i speaking to them
- Decision Process - Does the CEO need sign off
- Decision Criteria - What are the things you are assessing the tool on
- Process - Do you need a doc from us?
- Intent - What is the pain they are feeling and to what pain
- Champion - Who is the cheerleader in the buying company, man behind enemy lines, their interest to have their company buy the tool. -  they will feed you info from the other side
- Competition - are you actively speaking to other vendors?
- AE has a Quota to meet - the “sales”


Solutions Architects - helping PoCs for deep tech

Sales Enablement - Coaching Sales people to be better

Rev Ops - Processes or Tools, make sure things work

Customer Success - Keep Churn LOW, Retention HIGH and Expansion, point of contact for the buyer and helping make sure they are getting the most out of the tool. cross sell or up sell.



Managers are responsible for certain thigns

Pods?

SPLIT by: Territories: UK, Nordics, APAC, Southern Texas etc or Segment (Mid Market/Growth/Velocity,Commercial, SMBs, Enterprise (Headcount 5000+ or Revenue), Strategics (Biggest in world etc.))

CRO: 

VP of Sales: 

SPIF - Whichever SDR generates leads/booked meetings/attended meetings wins a new TV. Presidents club, Accelerate Comp.



Might have 3 SDRs to 1 AE or opposite 

- depends on where the leads come from 
- Companies usually have 70% of AEs hitting Quota. Set TOP down and thats how the company tracks growth. Will come from CEO to Rev leader. Have to hit Quota.
### After Sales





## Tools

- Not everyone will have access to everything.
- Marketing Tech
- 1000’s of marketing tools


- SDR
- Lowest part of the ladder, usually grads
- No authority in business, retention is super low (average tenure 9mo)
- repetitive actions - work is simple but not easy?
- human being to click the same kinds of buttons, or dial phone numbers, constant rejection.
- COLD Email, call, linkedIn DMs, Social Selling + interact with ecosystem, Speaking at Events booths.
- They need to hit their numbers


- Rev Ops 
- Supply account list to SDRs 
- use credit on Apollo to get email
- Sequence Outreach/Salesloft etc. - different steps, some manual some automated. 
- Day 1 Follow Person on LinkedIn.
- Day 2 Comment on their posts
- Day 3 Cold Email to them
- Day 4 Connection Request
- Day 5 Follow up email
- Day 6 - look at another person
- …
- Day 12 reach out to someone who can introduce them
- If they don’t have the tech they will put them where they want
- Might track them in their own way.
- There are lots of different techniques
- direct sales might work in a car workshop
- Sponsoring newsletter might be that
- Gong - Conversation inteligence, meeting recorder.
- Digital Sales Room
- Post thing relevant for buyer that they can share.
- Aware
- Create lists of people on LinkedIn, Like their comment or post!
- Head of Finance hire = signal


- Account Executives 
- OTE - base salary AND commission if you hit your targets. ratio of 4x to 6x 
- 


- Everyone supports Sales
- All is process 
- People to follow process
- Gettting 20yo to do repetitive action
- SDRs and Marketing are a function
- SDRs are a channel, such as LinkedIn or email is a channel. 


Rudder Stack

- helps move data arround
- 






- We’ll do growth consulting as a means to 1) gain insights and 2) provide stability of income for the two of us
- To get initial customers we will:
- Reach out to 1st degree founders on LinkedIn
Any chance you'd be open to sharing?

- Attend startup/busines and revenue-related events and meetups in London
- Join communities like Pavilion and other sales ones
- Have a look through what AI growth consultants like Attained and Genesys do
- Think about modules we can build with 1x growth person and 1x engineer
- e.g. pSEO; blogs; CDN; inbound infra; lead routing
- 1-click set up of all the growth infrastructure and channels




- Will give Jacob’s chrome extension thing a spin
- but acc considering pivoting to 1-click / agency /  Product Growth / content (growth) engine model
## New path (growth engine agency)

New path: on an agency model, we help early stage startups doing founder-led sales set up their demand / pipeline generation engine



Components of an engine:

- Process
- Best-in-class tools
- “raw input”
- Reporting (+ data pipeline glue)


Current pains:

- Non-technical
- Time-poor
- Lack of pipeline (!)


ICP:

- VC-backed, pre-seed/seed B2B SaaS commercial co-founder based in London
- we may want to expand to YC companies, and to the US
- Our Anti-ICP: B2C; PLG; Bootstrapped; series B+


What we solve:

- We create Growth stack


Our approach:

- We come in opinionated: we say this is how the best startups do it
- We start by learning as we go in implementing tools/channels, until we get to a point where we can copy paste the template of a MarTech stack


Our opinions:

- Experimentation
- re-purposing content
- auto-team engagement on posts
- Hygiene (right time of day, frequency, visual consistency)
- Templatise workflows, automate the manual, leave room for creative


Existing insights:

- He’s brute-forcing cold outbound by building lists on Apollo, manually researching on LinkedIn, then doing cold outreach
- He would be better off if he already had an audience, so as to build authority/credibility + network effects
- We believe there’s 3 archetypes for founder-led sales: 
1. pre-existing connections (Anders)
1. pre-existing audience (Slide Bean / Jay Hoovy)
1. cold + brute-force (Jacob from Ploy)
- He’s doing webinars and not re-purposing clips with subtitles because he doesn’t have time
- He paid an agency for Blogs, but they were only ever published on LI once, and SEO standards not followed
- Not technical enough to implement tools and build data pipelines, but open to spending budget on what would work
- He’s getting a paid employee to create content, but that employee themselves is busy and so is not posting every day
- He’s missed out on tools like The Swarm, Cabal, Commsor for go-to-network, because he hasn’t got time to assess software


Other streams of revenue:

- Be a referral partner for software like Assembly


Current streams of work: 

- Consulting
- Injecting AI into products
- growth engine implementation
- initial feeling is ICP should be founders who do NOT consistently post on social
- to make good content you need a strong pulse to be relevant + deep understanding of the space
- ICP for ‘founder social’ stream is VC-backed, pre-seed/seed B2B SaaS commercial co-founder based in London doing founder-led sales in a problem space that is not deeply technical and does not require deep domain expertise, that does not consistently post on LinkedIn already, and likely the company does not have an existing strong content motion, where mostly text-based thought leadership would suffice
- as we’re not an agency and not building out a tool to make this better, feels like our time may be better (given this would be low-revenue and low-insight, unlike say building out a growth engine)
- Micro SaaS
- painless account-based linkedin outreach Idea ⏸️
- Jacob’s research browser extension Product Dev ▶️


- current thinking is that we need to work on THE startup. Any time spent on other low-insight work is not worth it, because we’ll end up in the same position of needing money again to explore.




Thanks Amaan!



Good to connect Mike!



Before this upcoming cohort starts, would love to get a last minute chance to join. I’m perfectly timed to make the most of EF right now - I’m already full-time on exploring ideas and deep in the AI space.



Happy to share some of the things I’ve been working on if it helps:)

Andy:

- PM job at the BBC:
- Most of job is dealing with internal bureaucracy
- influence
- doing as much as possible within the setup of the org
- people talk about experimentation, but they don’t because it’s risky
- frustrating: the number of calls and meetings (at BBC)
- loads of notes from meetings but no central place
- frustrating: procurement process is so long, and policy is strict on self-serve (bureaucracy)
- they’re on a long term contract with sub-standard tools, but you can’t lobby the company on using a tool that is better fit for purpose
- analytics is a good example of that - as a PM if you have a bad analytics tool, your job is sabotaged, because you need to ask a team of SQL experts to build a query
- you’d export a SQL, then export as CSV, then you’d try to perform actions, but you don’t know whether you can eg. multiply or add the data because you don’t know if that data is made for that.
- he’s almost claimed something false, because he did something he wasn’t sure was right with the data
- the data team has a backlog, and you need to frontload lots of work, which pushes you not to be data-driven, because it’s painful
- frustrating: there are tools that will do it better that the company just hasn’t bought it
- frustrating for PMs: if you change something, you need to wait some number of months to collect data so that you can see if there are changes
- you want to run an experiment, but before you do that, you need to know the baseline first. so that takes time to set first, then the actual experiment too.
- but there are tools that track everything, but you can’t do that because it’s re-platforming and has so many dependencies that nothing ends up changing
- in a startup: you don’t have enough users or sample size for any experiment to have something statistically significant.
- When building an API, you build with postman, but it’s shit
- you can give it a schema of your API, but there’s nothing to auto-generate
- you might be writing in a language that it doesn’t support
- if you change the path to an endpoint, you then have to change all of the things you’ve saved in order to update it
- knowing all the endpoints and what they do in a big org blocks you from innovating, because you don’t know what’s available to you - where do you get the internal documentation for that. everything’s closed off. no access to other people’s stuff.
- As a product person: you just live in powerpoint and live in different docs, and you have to rally people around together
- there wasn’t a master slide deck
- being able to share things
- you have to use the prescribed tool “dropbox paper”
- managing all the different streams you have going on
- working within the tools the company has is massively limiting (e.g. jira)
- keeping track of all the projects you have going on in all the tools that you’re using is so much cognitive load
- he would just keep track of them in a doc
- sometimes people email you a deck - the actual file, not a link, so you would want to change it or comment on it, but then you have to download, and then it’s all out of sync and disjointed
- as a PM, you’re supposed to be on top of things
- reading emails - background noise you need to be aware of
- slack channels - so many you’re in. sometimes people don’t @ you because they don’t know you need to be involved
- you spend the first half of the day catching up on things that have happened
- doing everything in powerpoint, like product roadmap is so common, but using productboard is expensive, and it’s opinionated
- you then need to make it look nice in ppt
- there’s some things in there that’s sensitive that not all employees need to see
- having multiple stakeholders, means you share some things to some people, but you need to adjust slides to different levels in the hierarchy. you don’t everyone to know all sides of the stories, because you’re framing the story
- you might have it in Miro, but then where’s the source of truth? so you end up talking to engineers to know - too many sources of truth
- spending too long making powerpoints look good beyond the standard template
- sometimes has wanted to code a powerpoint with tailwind
- copy/pasting graphs from sheets into slides - look awful
- LetsRent
- evaluating what product/tool is right is hard and lots of time
- maintaining
- not having all the features in one place, would be spread across a couple of the same competitor tools
- building a newsletter, and setting it up
- making a simple list of emails and then send that group of people an email, vs sending an email to people who are helping, vs customers. having buckets is too much, pay too much to mailchimp, but wanted to track other than having a spreadsheet.
- he wasn’t posting on linkedin, also wasn’t using twitter, didn’t do on reddit - how to do without getting banned, facebook groups. so many things to do to grow, and you haven’t even got the product yet.
- tracking intros to people: is really difficult. he didn’t know a crm was a thing. he wanted it to listen to his emails and messages in any medium to be in one place. because at some point you interact with them on whatsapp. you can’t link all different mediums with one person’s identity, to be able to track that in an automated way. and not have the previous summary of notes. all the different days he’s had touchpoints with that person. tracking connectors and friends is hard. or maybe it’s someone who is doing freelance work for you, or someone helping.
- calendar: some things you do with your personal email, some with your work domain - such a nightmare.
- where is he keeping people’s emails - when he wants to add people to an event (it’s not going to auto-complete), you need to copy-paste it from somewhere.
- tracking all the tools that you’ve signed up to - are you paying for, what are the accounts you’re logged in to them (is it a shared email)? when do you need to pay for them. all the different email accounts. he wants a different email address to each one, so his email isn’t getting polluted with newsletter and app notifications. you want an audit trail, but you don’t want it to pollute.
- finding contract work:
- you need to know people, you just can’t apply. it’s not sustainable
- he still doesn’t know how to do his tax. there has to be some simple calculation. e.g. this is tax deductible, this isn’t. he hasn’t got time to categorise and do all the rest of his work.
- Momentum:
- would have liked a benchmark of what to ask for salary-wise.
- interacting with Pranav and Amrita - they were not technical enough. Amrita would send a screenshot with the URL he needed.
- sharing environment variables was annoying. someone would update them and not properly let you know, it would stop working, then you’d need to ask if someone updated them.
- requesting permission for things is annoying: e.g. access to our AWS account is annoying, and chasing them, and being blocked because they’re at lunch
- MMM were a waste of the engineer’s time. 
- they paid him in advance for the first month, so it was difficult to track the time after. tracking days you did or did not work was hard. isolated nightmare of his own doing.

Core value prop: 10x your employees

empowering existing employees to generate more value

10x the ROI on your workforce



the problem we solve: people know what they want to do, but they have to hold many things in their head to execute them all, and the speed of tools and switching context slows them down, when they want to do high level actions.



we’ll allow them to take multiple actions, within outside and joining together any of their custom tool stack that allows them to create custom productivity workflows that is bespoke to their toolstack and their individual way of working within their team’s way of working. That is utilising the specialist nature of each tool, we like individual tools because they are really good at their specific thing, but this helps maximise that by saying in natural language what you want to do within your toolset, constrained by your existing permission set.



every employee becomes a power user of every tool.



ideas:

- i love that we are automating manual work, but also 10xing employees, rather than firing people
- take who you have and give them superpowers.
- enterprise value: 10x productivity of workforce


how:

- chat interface that has access to all of your stack of tools as you that you are able to ask it to perform any action you could do, and it will utilise the tools your company has to execute that task on your behalf
- you have three options:
- single time request
- trigger on certain scenarios (that the AI learns based off of your repeated actions)
- cron-job (based off time)
- understands the context of your business - it doesn’t just know what actions you can take, it can read the content of the context that you’re in, and then learn the understanding of your business

# SaaS Sprawl Stats

## How many websites/saas/tools does a standard employee interact with in a day? 

Answer

Based on the search results, here are the key findings about how many SaaS tools and applications a typical employee interacts with in a day:The average employee uses 8-36 cloud-based services per day, depending on the source:

- One study found that the typical employee is dabbling in 36 cloud-based services in a day on average.
- Another source indicates that on average, an employee uses 8 SaaS applications.
Some additional relevant statistics:

- The average company has 254 SaaS apps, while enterprises have 364 apps.
- Companies with 50 or fewer employees have about 40 applications in total, while those with 1000+ employees have over 200.
- Most departments now have 40-60 tools each.
- In 2023, the average number of SaaS apps a business uses reached 371.
- The average company department uses 87 SaaS applications.
It's important to note that SaaS usage varies significantly based on company size, industry, and individual roles. However, the trend clearly shows that employees are interacting with a large number of SaaS tools on a daily basis, typically ranging from 8 to 36 different applications.This high number of applications can lead to challenges like SaaS sprawl, where companies struggle to manage and optimize their growing software portfolios. It also highlights the increasing reliance on cloud-based tools in modern workplaces for various business functions.

- need to up the ante
- need to build for enterprise.
- anton updated Andy on visa - will try to get one asap
- 2 actual biggest risks for right now: not finding the problem and not being able to move fast enough due to lack of in-house tech expertise


- We agreed on way forward for now: build a crystallised case study of a discrete use case/workflow that we make simple and easy look magical via: automating via chat.
- to find the problem workflows, I will reach out to founder’s associates, bizops, ICs
- Look through upwork for outsourced tasks
- 


- To build a case study, we need to find the people with the problem. 
- we need to discover the problem first. understand their top priorities and projects.
- why do they not currently use the available ai/automation/ai agents - is it not a big enough problem, are they not aware of solutions, are they too difficult to learn? what’s stopping
- are we building for a use case? a vertical (e.g. legal ai)? horizontal (’how modern work is done’)? a better way to automate that zapier et al haven’t done (what’s the moat if all we do is chat - wouldn’t zapier just do that)?


how we approach depends on who we want to speak to.



what they do

- work using a computer
- use automation tool
- spend time in spreadsheets
- move fast, have a lot to do


who they are

- operators at startups and small biz: bizops, founders associates, [early stage] founders, [early stage] heads of
- support role: executive assistant, chief of staff, founders associate, appointment-setter (see below)
- high-billing hourly work: lawyer, coach, doctor, dentist, 


how we reach them

operators:

- intros, events for operators, events for startups, conventions (at excel and london expos), cold LinkedIn, wework eavesdropping, reach out to ‘operators and friends’ organisers for intros, 
support role:

- join chief of staff groups (slack etc.), find founders associates
 





## Speak to

- People who use Zapier, n8n, make.com & relay about;
- Automations currently using
- what do they wish they could do but cant with the tools
- review popular templates on Zapier
- What tasks do they have in their Asana right now
- Upwork
- Events for this week
[ ] Book them in
- @Anton Muratov might go to Sweden 🇸🇪 next week for a NEW Passport


Use-cases to explore

- interact with your tools & perform actions via chat
- interact with all your tools via one interface
- api to any tool


[ ] confirmation statement 
[ ] strike off
[ ] Shadow company 
[ ] Jobs posted for problems or hiring companies a good target


- I’ve been interrupting - rude. 2 sides to it: 1) I’m being impatient and trying to guess and finish your thoughts for you (not good). 2) I want you to articulate your thoughts faster.
- Some bad habits: not giving each other full attention when discussing something important.
- sam lessin/slow ventures deck
- posthog on pmf (up to and including level 3)
- anton to synchronously share latest notes
Focus, cut scope, simplify:

1. Our current vision - SISPy
1. YC batch inspo - making the same mistake as above?
1. Automation & AI consultancy - discuss & commit
1. Jacob - treat him as our first customer
1. Make loom for him
1. Price SDR teams willing to pay for this = low. Perhaps still works at scale (30*$5). Better if selling to early b2b founders. ideas for distribution: 1) can run limited founder-led sales bootcamp (Kilian needed this). We can train for free, then sell a package we install. 2) substack newsletter: 101s + new tech review. 3) icp list + engage on socials and website, offer something via cold(ish) outreach.
1. plan and agree responsibilities for this path


Based on conversation with Rebecca Drew

- make a curriculum for small workshops and proposition for her to intro to communities and individuals
- for small businesses
- risk, opportunities and capabilities, business outcomes, setup

Hey X, [insert personalisation]! I’m a founder at an AI startup, I’m trying to specifically understand how to make marketing easier for early stage marketers, so I thought you’d have a really interesting take on this.

Can I ask you some questions on this?




1st search: \"marketing\" OR \"demand gen\" OR \"demand generation\" OR \"brand” - have opened up to 5 pages for ppl based in London





2nd search: “sales” OR “sdr” OR “sales development” OR “account executive” OR “AE”



Hey X, [insert personalisation]! I’m building a new venture, and super curious to learn about the work you do in marketing, so I thought you’d have a really interesting take on this. Any chance you’d be open to speaking sometime in the next week?


Hey Rossella! Really good to connect:) 

This is really out of the blue - I'm building a startup and am super curious to learn about how we can make the lives of marketing managers easier, so I thought you'd be the perfect person to speak to and learn from.

These kinds of conversations are super valuable in the early days of a startup. Any chance you’d be open to sharing?



Hey Robert! Really good to connect:)

This is so out of the blue - I'm building a startup in the productivity and automation space and am super curious to learn about the work that goes into demand gen, so I thought you'd be the perfect person to speak to and learn from.

These kinds of conversations are super valuable in the early days of a startup. Any chance you’d be open to sharing?



- What tools do you have open right now?
- How do you manage your tasks
- what tools do you use
- how does your team manage your tasks
- Interuptions → slack message or notification
- long runnign projects
- do you plan for when you do centain tasks in your calendar etc
- how much time do you spend in your task manager?






- Task sources
- breakdown from 


- you have to be the glue
- you have to be the glue
- not every tool talks to every other tool
- integrating X to Y relies on 
- X building an integration with Y AND Y building an integration with X 
- OR if they both integrate with Zappier then building an zap to connect them
- Zappier needs overhead


Idea Maze

What are all the bets and what is obvious that it will exist in the future?



Be the glue. Automation. 

Can we note down last week’s reflections on Notion? Just want to make sure we make good on the things we say we want to improve.

Sequoia 3 pmf archetypes from 22mins



retro:

Want to be transparent on visa and house stuff:

- I’m pushing it to go as fast as possible, but it will take 3 months regardless of effort due to structural reasons.
- I need to be in UK as much as possible up to (let’s say) 10th of January.
- Applying for Visa makes sense once we know when we want to be in SF and also once it’s right for us (see below).
- considering potentially renting it out from as soon as we get it to keep burn low (obv. means I’m staying up in north London).


SF:

- I fundamentally disagree that we need to be in SF to get an idea or get traction. It should not have to come to that. We’re in a top-3 startup hub and global economic hub - yes, in SF the conversion rate and frequency of conversations is higher, but we’re not in Mongolia - and an inability to generate anything here says nothing about London and everything about us. Now - I need to stress that it’s only been a month and I’ve seen it take longer for other startups, we don’t need to trash ourselves. I recognise that the finances situation is making us anxious and perhaps that is clouding our judgement to some degree.
- With that said - SF can be a huge boost for us, IF we use it well. And we can make the most of it if we have ACTUAL traction, or at least actual conviction and some kind of evidence of progress.
- I don’t want this to be perceived as me slowing us down or being cautious: this is the useful part of our yin and yang, I’m keeping us HONEST about the only thing that matters (customers paying us to solve problem) and pushing us to take real action (that is - building for customers is real action, networking in SF is something we tell ourselves is a prerequisite to action, which is false). Not trying to prematurely optimise, but obviously having traction also gives us leverage and puts us in a position of power to seize opportunities, not go around begging.
- I’m also aware that the trip to SF would be to attempt to raise money because our finances are bad, to which I say: we haven’t even tried raising here + see midwit meme.


### Feedback:

Good

- on the whole: spending more time together has been good. I’ve noted that I’ve been better at articulating ideas when writing and also that it’s been very helpful when I have to myself to think or when running or in the gym.


Bad

- Not assuming you would want to be CEO
- tech abilities


To improve

- I want to apologise that I assumed that you would not be CEO
- I also want to apologise that I didn’t come to understand your technical abilities from a place of curiosity. I realise now as well, that it would be incredibly helpful for me to understand what you feel confident building vs what is not your strong suit (I’m always thinking about ETL, syncing data, data pipelines etc, and I just don’t know whether this is an area you have experience in or not).
- re:emotional regulation following the above points (but thank you for being honest - that matters far, far more): seeing you get irritated (but being able to label the emotion and then tell me that is so good, I really admire it) and sometimes seeing you get demotivated if we didn’t get somewhere or have been rejected etc- it totally makes sense because we have urgency, I worry that it may come out (eg in the form of getting defensive or shutting down) at times when it matters far more, like when the life of the business is on the line. I say this purely with good intention and wanting us both to have a growth mindset, not at all to put you down or shame you for feeling the feels - I 100% have times I do this too, I just want us to be able to have open and honest conversations about difficult things so we can improve. To be very clear - I think you handled it well and I’m thankful you were honest.


General:

- being honest with ourselves: I don’t think I would be the right person to build the devtool/API for AI startups, because ultimately to sell well you need to know the market and customer better than customers do. I also want to acknowledge a concern I have, that ‘boring’ industries may inherently be unappealing to you, and how that limits our range of opportunities to only the exciting things. We need to be motivated by whatever we build, so it makes sense, but I worry that we will self-select into building ‘s3xy’ ideas (read: tarpit). It also takes us away from potential good areas to work on because they’re something that should be solved already (like stripe, Lago and countless others are doing).












- met and decided to work on the RAM problem (dependencies + multiple contexts) of computer-based work. People know the outcome they want, it takes too much work to get there - we want to work on the problems in that gap.
- committed to getting in motion and figuring everything else out from there. starting with supafetch.
- Andy to build out supafetch to be able to do RAG on a URL, Anton to find customers to run hypothesis on whether their problem is relevant.

- feels like a lot of ppl work in pharma and do clinical trial applications. they use software like veeva vault and Regulatory Information Management systems (RIMs), and have to comply to EU clinical trials regulations (it’s a specific law). Seems like there are 
- there are several advanced players in this space already - seems like it needs a lot of niche vertical expertise.
- interesting overview of what goes into regulatory affairs
- one intern’s task: “Assisted in citing, tracking, and organizing approximately 500 references for the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) submission using Microsoft Excel”
- feels like spray and pray is a good forcing function for understanding who is ICP and who is not. Have realised that if we DO book meetings with people, they will be informative, but they’ll be less likely to just onboard onto our thing - it’s not personalised for any industry or use case.
- most people with compliance in title are in finance. some are in legal work.
- insight: compliance is a cost-centre, it doesn’t result in growth.
- it’s very important when things go wrong, but it makes up a small footprint on companies’ P&L
- they’re risk-averse by nature. they’re not innovators.
- 
- very broad job descriptions so far
- young ICs are much more responsive. 8/52 connected on day 1.
